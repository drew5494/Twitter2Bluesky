# Twitter2Bluesky

This project is designed to monitor the latest tweets from a specific Twitter account in real-time and post the updates to Bluesky, a decentralized social network. Using the `twikit` library, the script fetches the latest tweets from Twitter and will eventually integrate Bluesky's API for seamless cross-posting.

## Install
To get started, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install asyncio aiohttp requests beautifulsoup4 twikit atproto
